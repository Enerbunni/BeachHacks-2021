# BeachHacks-2021
This is Evan Haut and Taylor Girard's project for the BeachHacks 2021 Hackathon!

It's a calendar that can:
* take user entry into individual days
* save the user's entry to the computer
* load saved entries back onto the calendar
* switch between the months (only valid in the century 2000)
